## Description

**Decor Treasure Hunt** automatically accepts, tracks, and completes the daily Decor Treasure Hunt quest, making it easy to find the hidden decoration item on your island.

### Features

- **Automatic Waypoint** - Waypoint is set automatically when you accept the quest
- **Blizzard Map Integration** - Uses the native WoW waypoint system with super tracking
- **TomTom Support** - Optional integration with TomTom for enhanced waypoint functionality
- **Smart Detection** - Automatically detects if you already have the quest active when logging in
- **Fully Automated** - Automatically accepts and turns in the Decor Treasure Hunt quest
- **Configurable** - Toggle auto-accept/turn-in via the Addon Compartment at your minimap
- **Fully Localized** - Supports all WoW client languages

### How It Works

1. Talk to the quest giver, the addon automatically accepts the "Decor Treasure Hunt" quest
2. A waypoint is automatically created at the treasure location
3. Follow the waypoint on your map and minimap to find and dig up the decoration
4. Click the treasure chest, the addon automatically turns in the quest

**Don't like auto-accept/turn-in?** Click the Addon Compartment icon (the small number near your minimap) to disable this feature!

### Perfect For

Players who want to efficiently complete their **daily decoration grind** across **multiple characters** without searching the entire island or consulting external guides every single day!
